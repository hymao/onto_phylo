I found some chars that seemingly have to be revised:
116. Foreleg  procoxa (HAO:0001315(procoxal foramen)). Procoxal foramen is not implied by HAO relationships as an item of procoxa.
Either HAO:0001315 have to be related as part_of procoxa in HAO or char 116 have to be linked with procoxa.
The script suggested HAO:0001122(procoxa)

2.Supraantennal groove or depression (HAO:0001432(antennal scrobe)). Similar to the previous char. HAO:0001432 is
not related to antenna but have to be linked somehow. The script suggested HAO:0000101(antenna)

155. This char is missing in HAO annotaions.
